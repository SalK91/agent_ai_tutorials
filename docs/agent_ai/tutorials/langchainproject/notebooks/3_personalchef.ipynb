Top with chopped scallions, crushed peanuts, and a soft-boiled egg (optional).  \\n\\n**Pro tip**: Add pickled radishes or kimchi for tangy depth!  \\n\\nThis zesty, no-cream version is perfect for a quick, healthy lunch. Want more ideas? Let me know! 🥢✨', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'Okay, the user wants a different lunch using chicken, broccoli, and rice than the previous dinner. Let me think. The previous dinner was a creamy, cheesy casserole-style dish. Now they need something distinct for lunch.\\n\\nFirst, they might want something quicker or lighter. Since they mentioned \"different,\" maybe a cold or room temperature dish. Let\\'s consider options. \\n\\nA chicken broccoli rice salad could work. It\\'s a common dish but needs to be unique. Maybe add some Asian flavors? Like a sesame ginger dressing. That would add a different flavor profile than the cheesy version. \\n\\nWhat ingredients do they have? Chicken, broccoli, rice. They might have basic pantry items like soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, rice vinegar. Maybe suggest adding some crunch with nuts or seeds. Also, some veggies like carrots or bell peppers if available. \\n\\nSteps would be: cook the rice, shred the chicken, steam broccoli, mix with a dressing. Serve cold. Add some toppings for texture. \\n\\nI should check if there are any dietary restrictions, but the user hasn\\'t mentioned any. So, proceed with the recipe. Make sure to mention it\\'s a quick, healthy option. Maybe include a link to a reliable source if available, but since they want a different approach than the previous search, maybe just outline the recipe here. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe a sushi bowl? Using rice, chicken, broccoli, and some avocado or sesame seeds. That\\'s another unique take. But sushi might require more specific ingredients. The user might prefer something simpler. \\n\\nSticking with the salad idea. Let\\'s structure the response with a recipe that\\'s easy to make, uses their ingredients, and is different in flavor from the previous meal. Highlight the dressing and toppings to make it special.\\n'}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 561, 'prompt_tokens': 1766, 'total_tokens': 2327, 'completion_time': 1.4866337920000001, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 359}, 'prompt_time': 0.077833895, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.202936013, 'total_time': 1.564467687}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_efa9879028', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019b89f0-8d70-7bf0-bac1-1825359ce5aa-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1766, 'output_tokens': 561, 'total_tokens': 2327, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 359}})]}"
