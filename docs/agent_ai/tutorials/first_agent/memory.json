It offers a great vantage point to witness the fireworks over the city skyline. Address: Greenwich Park, London SE10 8QY. Getting there: The park is accessible by various transport options. You can take the DLR to Cutty Sark station, which is a short walk away, or use bus routes 129, 177, 180, 188, 199, 286, 386, or N1.\n\n2. **Canary Wharf Area**: While not a specific spot, the Canary Wharf district itself is a popular choice for fireworks viewing. The skyscrapers and waterfront provide a stunning backdrop for fireworks displays. You can explore locations like Canada Square or the area around the Canary Wharf Pier for excellent views. Transport: Canary Wharf is well-connected with its own DLR station and Jubilee line underground station.\n\n3. **Nearby Rooftop Bars and Restaurants**: Several establishments in the area offer rooftop views, providing a unique and elevated perspective for fireworks displays.
