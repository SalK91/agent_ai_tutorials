There are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including:

The Claude Agent SDK;
Strands Agents SDK by AWS;
Rivet, a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and
Vellum, another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows.
These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts ​​and responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice.
